									<p>
										IEEE Quarterly Projects are your path to a great project experience. With more time 
										than a hackathon, but without the commitment of an annual project, build a project 
										over the quarter that you are proud of while joining a team of 3 or even forming your
										own team with 2 other friends! *Quarterly Projects is multi-disciplinary* and is 
										inclusive to all interested in engineering, so anyone is welcome and encouraged to apply! </br> </br>
											
										Once accepted IEEE Quarterly Projects you have access to *mentors and workshops* such
										that you have the opportunities to create the best project you can, and of course 
										supplement you resume by demonstrating to others your ability and drive to create 
										projects outside of the classroom. Building a project in Quarterly Projects is one 
										of the best ways to get the hard skills AND soft skills that you need to get hired
										and build further relationships in college! </br> </br>

									<h2 class="major">Annual Projects</h2>
									<p>
										Every year, IEEE at UC San Diego sponsors teams to participate in building the project 
										and attending competitions. Applicants are put in teams and go through the process of designing, 
										fabricating, testing and competing with their project. Along the way, participants will learn 
										collaboration and research skills that come with team-based projects while being able to apply
										their academic knowledge in a competitive environment. </br> </br>

										At the end of the project, the team has access to their team website and live demos of their robot, 
										allowing them to show off their work to impress both recruiters and friends. Applications for annual 
										projects open at the beginning of every fall quarter! </br> </br>
